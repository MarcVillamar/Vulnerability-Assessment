### Objective

In this lab, I conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small company based on the NIST SP 800-30.

### Skills Learned

- Assess a vulnerability assessment based on company assets.
- Identify weaknesses on a company based on the NIST SP 800-30.
- Work using NIST SP 800-30 to identify threat sources, threat events, likelyhood of a threat event, and severity of a threat event.
- Create a detailed report with a scope, a purpose, the risk assessment and recomdations.
- Use critical thinking and problem-solving skills to do the report and find a solution to address the risk assessment based on the NIST SP 800-30.

### Tools Used

- NIST SP800-30 documentation to address the risk assessment and implement a solution.

- Third is to actually assess and use critical thinking on how the given scenario needs to have the NIST SP800-30 implemented to increase the security posture.
